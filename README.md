The Open Traceable Time Platform is an open-source solution for a timing system that can be made fully
traceable to national standards. It achieves traceability using the GPS common-view technique, 
which allows distant clocks to be compared with an accuracy of a few ns. 
The reference platform is based on readily available, low-cost OEM modules and provides a full software and hardware solution.
	
# Local modifications

I (Tim Lister) am making local modifications to broaden the range of systems that the software will run on and the devices that are supported. Currently I am working on:
1) Support for Raspberry Pis (DONE)
2) Support for ublox 6 chipsets such as the LEA-6T (IN PROGRESS, partly working)
3) Support for other time interval counters (TICs) such as the HP 5334A/B (IN PROGRESS, partly working) and the HP 5370 (PLANNED)

Progress on these and general info on installing and getting OpenTTP running is on my blog at: https://adventuresinprecision.space/tag/openttp/
